Properties of Regular polygons
Some of the properties of regular polygons are listed below.

All the sides of a regular polygon are equal
All the interior angles are equal
The perimeter of a regular polygon with n sides is equal to the n times of a side measure.
The sum of all the interior angles of a simple n-gon or regular polygon = (n − 2) × 180°
The number of diagonals in a polygon with n sides = n(n – 3)/2
The number of triangles formed by joining the diagonals from one corner of a polygon = n – 2
The measure of each interior angle of n-sided regular polygon = [(n – 2) × 180°]/n
The measure of each exterior angle of an n-sided regular polygon = 360°/n



area of reqular polygon = ((l^2)*n)/(4tan(PI/n))
l is the side length

n is the number of sides
